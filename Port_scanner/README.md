# 🌐 Port Scanner

This Python-based port scanner allows users to scan a **network host** and identify **open ports**. The tool provides a **scan time** and a list of **open ports**, which can be useful for network security assessments, penetration testing, and system administration.

## ✨ Features

✅ Scan a specified **host** for open ports  
✅ Display the **open ports** with the corresponding numbers  
✅ Show the **time** it took to complete the scan  
✅ User-friendly command-line interface

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

| Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Python** | Core programming language for implementing the port scanner |
| **socket** | Python library for network connections and scanning ports |
| **time** | Measure the time it takes to complete the port scan |

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The program asks the user for the **host** (IP address or domain name) to scan.
2. It then scans the host for **open ports** by attempting to connect to common ports (e.g., 80, 443, 22, etc.).
3. The **scan time** is measured, showing how long it took to complete the scan.
4. The program returns a list of **open ports** on the specified host.
